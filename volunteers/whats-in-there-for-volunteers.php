				<h1>What's In There For Volunteers</h1>
				<p>
					The today’s generation is very competitive. Work in any field and you will find many competitors willing to face you and beat you but we won’t let this happen to the candidates linked to us. A certification of participation in the event would not add up to your resume but also the candidates would be able to make contacts with high class people or experts which would surely help one way or the other in the later run.
