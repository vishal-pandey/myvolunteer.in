				<h1>What We Do? And What Can You Do?</h1>
				<p>
					My volunteers assist on the event day for setup, guest assistance, and registration etc. Volunteers may also choose to be involved in event planning.
				</p>
				<p>
					Event volunteers work under the direction of various members of the event committee who will provide task-specific training.
				</p>
				<p>
					My Volunteer was setup to respond to various events, as well as responding to calls for large groups of people to volunteer at community events such as concerts, environmental events, sporting events and community events. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Roles may include acting as event ambassadors, providing information to the general public, as well as promoting My Volunteers at our Volunteer Hub.  Much of the volunteering will be outdoor and include some physical activity so volunteers will be expected to bear this in mind when volunteering to be part of My Volunteer.  We will not undertake fund raising roles for an organisation.
