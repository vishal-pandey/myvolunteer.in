					<b>Join our team and become an Event Volunteer at some of the best events and festivals</b><br><br>

					My Volunteer was set up to respond to various events, as well as responding to calls for large groups of people to volunteer at festivals and events. Joining My Volunteer provides you with a great opportunity to be part of the action, meet new people, develop new skills and engage with the general public. We provide a mobile event and information service to people attending events and festivals. Volunteer roles at these events may include acting as event ambassadors, manning registration desks, production support and much more. As a source of information about the event, local facilities and transport links, our role is to make sure visitors to an event have all the information they need to enjoy their time. All our volunteers are provided with induction, training and orientation prior to the events so there is a clear understanding of what is involved. Volunteering with My Volunteer is an opportunity to put your skills to use in one of the most diverse communities in the country. If you are aged 16 or over (18 in the case of some events) you can apply to become an Event Volunteer. You can fill out an online application form at <a href="http://www.myvolunteer.in/">http://www.myvolunteer.in/</a>
